Course Description
------------------

This will be an introductory course in generalized geometry, with a special emphasis on Dirac geometry, as developed by Courant, Weinstein, and Severa, as well as generalized complex geometry, as introduced by Hitchin. Dirac geometry is based on the idea of unifying the geometry of a Poisson structure with that of a closed 2-form, whereas generalized complex geometry unifies complex and symplectic geometry. For this reason, the latter is intimately related to the ideas of mirror symmetry. The basic reference will be an article by M. Gualtieri, as listed under textbooks but we will also draw from more recent developments in the physics literature. A basic familiarity with complex and symplectic manifolds will be assumed.

### Topics will Include

*   Gerbes, B-fields, and Exact Courant Algebroids
*   Relation to Sigma Models in Physics and Baby String Theory
*   Linear Algebra of a Split-Signature Real Bilinear Form; Pure Spinors
*   Generalized Riemannian Structures and The Generalized Hodge Star
*   Integrability, Dirac structures, Lie Algebroids and Bialgebroids
*   Generalized Complex Structures; Examples of Such
*   Generalized Holomorphic Bundles; the Picard Group
*   Kodaira-Spencer-Kuranishi Deformation Theory For Generalized Complex Structures
*   Local Structure Theory For Generalized Complex Structures
*   Generalized Kahler Geometry
*   Hodge Decomposition Theorem For Generalized Kahler Structures
*   Hermitian Geometry; The Gray-Hervella Classification
*   Equivalence Theorem Generalized Kahler=Bihermitian
*   Generalized Calabi-Yau Structures and The Hitchin Functional
*   Ramond-Ramond Versus Neveu-Schwarz Fluxes; D-Branes
